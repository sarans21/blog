I started photography in April 2025. Here my best works so far:

![The Clock](/assets/articles/my_best_photos_so_far/The Clock.JPG "The Clock, also shot with my wife's Fujifilm X-T100 with Kit Lens. This is the photo that started it all.")

Funny thing is I almost deleted the above photo because I didn't know if it's good or bad, but my wife convinced me to not delete it and look at it again. Then I started to see the photo differently. Suddenly my eyes changed forever.

After I knew I like photography, I studied a lot and decided to buy my own camera focusing on landscape photography. Although I haven't had chances to travel a lot yet, here my best photos shot with it during my mini trips:

I also enjoy shooting portraits and some environments lately. I love my portraits of my wife a lot. You can find them on my Instagram: [@x00h](https://www.instagram.com/x00h/).

Until next time!
